    This dossier examines the economic and structural forces shaping the large-language-model sector.

In technology markets, one belief is repeated so often that it has acquired the status of a law: being first is an advantage. Investors look for first movers. Headlines celebrate early leaders. Analysts construct charts ranking companies by how far ahead they appear to be.

The assumption is simple. Whoever leads early should win late.

But that assumption quietly relies on conditions that do not always hold.

It is true that early leadership can confer real benefits. The first company to scale infrastructure can build recognition, attract talent, secure partnerships, and define standards. Under stable technological conditions, those advantages compound. This is the familiar logic behind network effects and platform dominance, and it explains many historical winners.

Yet some industries operate under a fundamentally different set of dynamics. In these environments, efficiency improves rapidly, methods spread quickly, and the cost of achieving a given level of performance falls over time. When that decline accelerates, industries can enter what can be called a *cost-collapse* phase: a period in which each successive generation becomes dramatically cheaper to produce than the last.

The distinction between variable and fixed cost becomes decisive here. Training a system may be expensive, but it is episodic. Infrastructure is continuous. Data centers, hardware procurement agreements, power contracts, and specialized networking architectures represent long-lived financial obligations. They are not easily unwound or replaced. They must be amortized across years of operation.

If technological progress proceeds gradually, those commitments can be justified and absorbed. But if efficiency improves faster than expected, the ground shifts. A competitor entering later may be able to achieve comparable performance at a fraction of the cost, using newer hardware, refined methods, or improved architectures. The late entrant inherits the lessons of the early pioneer without inheriting its balance sheet. This dynamic is especially relevant in the large-model sector, where infrastructure costs scale faster than most other inputs.

At that point, the question is no longer who is ahead. The question is who is exposed.

## The Inhibiting Lead

History provides repeated examples of this pattern. Telecommunications firms that built vast networks before bandwidth prices collapsed found themselves burdened by infrastructure sized for an earlier cost regime. Manufacturing sectors that invested heavily in first-generation production lines were undercut by competitors using newer, cheaper processes. In each case, early leadership did not disappear—but it ceased to guarantee advantage. The investments that once secured dominance began to constrain adaptation.

The underlying mechanism is straightforward. When cost curves collapse faster than capital can be amortized, early investment converts from an advantage into a structural liability. Capability can be reproduced; fixed commitments cannot be undone.

In industries shaped by rapid optimization and knowledge diffusion, this inversion is especially likely. Techniques propagate. Efficiency gains accumulate. Barriers to entry shift from discovery to execution. As a result, the performance gap between leaders and followers narrows over time, while the cost gap between early and late infrastructure can widen.

This is the dynamic that conventional “race” narratives overlook. They assume progress is linear and advantages persist. But in certain technological regimes, the decisive factor is not how far ahead a company is today. It is how expensive it was to get there.

We can give this pattern a name: **the inhibiting lead**. It describes the condition in which the very investments that created early leadership later restrict a firm’s ability to adapt. The lead still exists, but it inhibits flexibility rather than securing dominance. This dynamic is not new. In 1937, Dutch historian Jan Romein identified the same pattern as the “law of the handicap of a head start” (*remmende voorsprong*): the tendency for early leaders to become constrained by the structures that once gave them advantage.

Recognizing this possibility changes how an industry must be analyzed. Instead of asking which firm is winning, the more relevant question becomes which firms are positioned to remain competitive if the underlying economics shift. That requires looking not only at capability and market share, but at cost structures, capital exposure, and technological trajectories.

First-mover advantage is real. But it is not universal, and it is not permanent. In sectors defined by rapid efficiency gains, the most dangerous position may not be behind the leaders.

It may be among them.
