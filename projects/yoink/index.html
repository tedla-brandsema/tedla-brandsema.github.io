    <h1>Yoink</h1>

    <p>Yoink is a stripped-down version of the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/present">GO present tool</a>. Yoink is built to include
        (partial) files into other
        files, from local or remote sources, over HTTP(S).</p>

    <p>You can extend Yoink by creating your own commands.</p>

    <p>Yoink is available as a library or as a commandline tool. For instructions on how to build and use Yoink via the
        commandline, see the <a target="_blank" href="/projects/yoink/guides/yoink-on-the-commandline.html">Yoink On The
            Commandline</a> guide.</p>

        <strong>Note:</strong> Yoink is a line-based, flat-include library. It has no contextual awareness of any
        hierarchical/nested structures. You can use Yoink in such structures (e.g. HTML, JSON, etc.), but know that
        you can end up with invalid output.

        <h2>Why Yoink?</h2>
        <p>The GO present tool:
        <ol>
            <li>produces either Markdown or HTML;</li>
            <li>parses commands sequentially and not concurrently;</li>
            <li>does not possess the ability to include remote files over HTTP(S).</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>The existing API of the GO present tool does offer the ability to expand it to include remote files over
            HTTP(S), but it is not exposed in a way that makes it easy to use. As for points one (output format) and
            two (sequential parsing), those are tightly integrated into the parser and not achievable within the bounds
            of the API.</p>

        <p>This, by no means, is meant as criticism. The GO present tool was made with a very specific task in mind,
            and it executes that task splendidly. Yoink was made for another use case and the GO present
            tool is an ideal springboard to achieve that purpose.</p>
