<main>
    <p>I am Tedla Brandsema, a software engineer and independent researcher based in the Netherlands.</p>

    <p>My work spans software architecture, research and development, and technical consultancy. I am the founder of
        Cloudberry IT, through which I have worked on large-scale systems, distributed infrastructure, and long-horizon
        engineering projects.</p>

    <p>In addition to my professional work, I pursue independent research and writing on topics related to artificial
        intelligence, machine learning, and the economic and structural dynamics of complex technological systems.</p>

    <p>I do not operate within a single fixed discipline. Instead, I tend to follow problems that I find intellectually
        compelling, which means the subjects I work on can vary over time. What they generally share is a focus on
        foundational questions, system design, and the long-term implications of technological change.</p>

    <p>This site is a public record of my writing, research publications, and open-source software projects.</p>
