title: Yoink — The Address Argument
---

{% include nav-yoink.html %}

<main>
    <h1>The Address Argument</h1>
    <p>Yoinks most useful and powerful feature is the ability to target a specific region by adding an address at the
        end of a <code class="language-none">.yoink</code> command.</p>

    <p>The address syntax is similar in its simplest form to that of the text editor <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/">ed</a>, but comes from the sam text editor and is more general. See
        Table II of <a target="_blank" href="https://plan9.io/sys/doc/sam/sam.html">The Text Editor sam</a> paper for
        more details. Note that the displayed block is always rounded out to a full line at both ends.</p>

    <p>In our previous examples, we only included entire files into our base file. With the help of the address
        argument, however, we can target a specific region or excerpt from a file.</p>

    <p>Consider the following base file:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-none">
Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
By William Shakespeare

.yoink sonnet-18-quatrains.txt /START stanza-2/,/END stanza-2/

.yoink sonnet-18-rhyming-couplet.txt

.yoink sonnet-18-quatrains.txt /START stanza-3/,/END stanza-3/

.yoink sonnet-18-quatrains.txt /START stanza-1/,/END stanza-1/
        </code></pre>

    <p>Here you can see that all .yoink commands that point to sonnet-18-quatrains.txt have a second argument. This
        argument is an <em>address</em>.</p>

    <p>The address of the first <code class="language-none">.yoink</code> command reads as follows:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-none">
/START stanza-2/,/END stanza-2/
        </code></pre>

    <p>If you take a look at Table II of <a target="_blank" href="https://plan9.io/sys/doc/sam/sam.html">The Text Editor
            sam</a> manual, we see that we have a regular expression <code class="language-none">/START stanza-2/</code>
        followed by the address mark <code class="language-none">,</code>, and finally we have a second regular
        expression <code class="language-none">/END stanza-2/</code>. The
        regular expressions here are just literal matches, but note that you can use more involved regular expression
        pattern matching syntax.</p>

    <p>The addresses in our base file correspond to demarcations in our target file sonnet-18-quatrains.txt. See below:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-none">
#START stanza-1
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
#END stanza-1

#START stanza-2
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
#END stanza-2

#START stanza-3
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
#END stanza-3               
            </code></pre>

    <p>Running the jumbled base file with Yoink, yields the following result.</p>

Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

#START stanza-2
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
#END stanza-2

So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

#START stanza-3
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
#END stanza-3

#START stanza-1

Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
#END stanza-1

    <p>We succeeded in jumbling the output using addresses, but we now have the undesirable effect that the address
        demarcations ended up in the resulting output.</p>

    <p>Luckily we have a way to circumvent this: all lines that ends with the four characters <code
            class="language-none">OMIT</code> are not included in the final output.</p>

    <p>So if we were to append the demarcations with <code class="language-none">OMIT</code> as shown below:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-none">
#START stanza-1 OMIT
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

#START stanza-2 OMIT
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
#END stanza-2 OMIT

#START stanza-3 OMIT
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
#END stanza-3 OMIT
</code></pre>

    <p>And update the regular expressions in the base file to match the new demarcations:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-none">

.yoink sonnet-18-quatrains.txt /START stanza-1 OMIT/,/END stanza-1 OMIT/
        </code></pre>

    <p>We get the desired jumbled output, but without the demarcation lines:</p>
