title: Yoink — The Address Argument

{% include nav-yoink.html %}

<main>
    <h1>The Address Argument</h1>
    <p>Yoinks most useful and powerful feature is the ability to target a specific region by adding an address at the
        end of a <code class="language-none">.yoink</code> command.</p>

    <p>The address syntax is similar in its simplest form to that of ed, but comes from sam and is more general. See
        Table II of <a target="_blank" href="https://plan9.io/sys/doc/sam/sam.html">The Text Editor sam</a> manual for
        full details. The displayed block is always rounded out to a full line at both ends.</p>

    <p>In our previous examples, we only included entire files into our base file. With the help of the address
        argument, however, we can target a specific region or excerpt from a file.</p>

    <p>Consider the following base file:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-none">
Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
By William Shakespeare

.yoink sonnet-18-quatrains.txt /START stanza-2/,/END stanza-2/

.yoink sonnet-18-rhyming-couplet.txt

.yoink sonnet-18-quatrains.txt /START stanza-3/,/END stanza-3/

.yoink sonnet-18-quatrains.txt /START stanza-1/,/END stanza-1/
        </code></pre>

    <p>Here you can see that all .yoink commands that point to sonnet-18-quatrains.txt have a second argument. This
        argument is an <em>address</em>.</p>

    <p>The address of the first <code class="language-none">.yoink</code> command reads as follows:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-none">
/START stanza-2/,/END stanza-2/
        </code></pre>

    <p>If you take a look at Table II of <a target="_blank" href="https://plan9.io/sys/doc/sam/sam.html">The Text Editor
            sam</a> manual, we see that we have a regular expression <code class="language-none">/START stanza-2/</code>
        followed by the address mark <code class="language-none">,</code>, and finally we have a second regular
        expression <code class="language-none">/END stanza-2/</code>. The
        regular expressions here are just literal matches, but note that you can use more involved regular expression
        pattern matching syntax.</p>

        <p>The addresses in our base file correspond to demarcations in our target file sonnet-18-quatrains.txt. See below:</p>

            <pre><code class="language-none">
#START stanza-1
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
#END stanza-1

#START stanza-2
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
#END stanza-2

#START stanza-3
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
#END stanza-3               
            </code>
