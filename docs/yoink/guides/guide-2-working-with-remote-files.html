    <h1>Working with Remote Files</h1>

    <p>Including remote files works much the same as working with local files; you add the <code
            class="language-none">.yoink</code> command to the start of a line, but instead of adding the name of the
        file to include, you add the URL of the file to include.</p>

    <p>In the example below, there are two <code class="language-none">.yoink</code> commands pointing to URLs with raw
        text data.</p>

        <code class="language-none">

    <p>Parsing of a file that contains a <code class="language-none">.yoink</code> command that points to a URL is
        exactly the same as parsing a file with <code class="language-none">.yoink</code> commands that point to local
        files.</p>

    <pre>
        <code class="language-go">
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/tedla-brandsema/yoink"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Open the root file
	name := "./data/sonnet-18-remote.txt"
	file, err := os.Open(name)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer file.Close()

	// Resolve .yoink commands in the root file
	txt, err := yoink.Parse(context.Background(), file, name)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(txt)
}            
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Running the program yields the exact same result as in the "Getting started" example.</p>

Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
By William Shakespeare

Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:

So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
