    <h1>Getting started</h1>
    <p>Yoink is an include engine for text based files. You point it at a root file, mark inclusion points with
        <code class="language-none">.yoink</code> commands, and it returns a single expanded document.</p>

        <h2>Installing The Library</h2>

        <p>Use <code class="language-none">go get</code> to install the latest version of the library.</p>

        <pre><code class="language-none">go get -u github.com/tedla-brandsema/yoink@latest</code></pre>

        <p>Then, import Yoink in your application:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-go">import "github.com/tedla-brandsema/yoink"</code></pre>

        <h2>Working With Local Files</h2>

        <p>You can include local files by adding the <code class="language-none">.yoink</code> command at the start of a
            line, followed by the
            name of the file to include. Below is an example file that contains two such commands.</p>

Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
By William Shakespeare

.yoink sonnet-18-quatrains.txt

.yoink sonnet-18-rhyming-couplet.txt
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>Above we see two <code class="language-none">.yoink</code> commands: one command pointing to <code
                class="language-none">sonnet-18-quatrains.txt</code> and the other to <code
                class="language-none">sonnet-18-rhyming-couplet.txt</code>.</p>

        <p>To let Yoink resolve those commands, we first need to
            open our root file and then pass it to <code class="language-none">yoink.Parse</code> in the form of an
            <code class="language-none">io.Reader</code>.
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-go">
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/tedla-brandsema/yoink"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Open the root file
	name := "./data/sonnet-18.txt"
	file, err := os.Open(name)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer file.Close()

	// Resolve .yoink commands in the root file
	txt, err := yoink.Parse(context.Background(), file, name)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(txt)
}
            </code>
         </pre>


        <p>Running the program yields the following result:</p>

Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
By William Shakespeare

Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:

So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Yoink lets you stitch files together by declaring <code class="language-none">.yoink</code> commands in your
            source text. The parser reads the root file, resolves each include, and returns a single, expanded
            document.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Add <code class="language-none">.yoink &lt;path&gt;</code> lines where you want content to be inserted.</li>
            <li>Open the root file and pass it to <code class="language-none">yoink.Parse</code> with the file name.</li>
            <li>Use the returned string as the fully resolved document.</li>
        </ul>
